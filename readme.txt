1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
answer 1: 
getElementById: getElementById finds an element by using it's id. since Id is unique, getElementById returns unique element.  

getElementsByClassName: getElementsByClassName find elements by their classNames.
multiple elements can have same class. so, it can return an HTML collection of elements. 

querySelector: querySelector finds the first element that matches the CSS selector (is, attribute, class, tag, etc. ). It always returns null elements or null if  nothing is found. 

querySelectorAll: querySelectorAll finds all elements that match a given CSS selector.

4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Answer 4: event delegation is a pattern in JavaScript , where instead of attaching event listeners with multiple child, event listeners are attached with parent and use event bubbling to catch events from the children.

Importance of event delegation:
i. saves memory and speeds up performance. Instead of attaching many event listener, attaching only 1 event listener on single parent can help. 
ii. Dynamic- new elements added later, automatically works
